# DocumenterCitations.jl
Using [Bibliography.jl](https://github.com/Azzaare/Bibliography.jl) to add support for BibTeX citations and references in documentation pages generated by [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl).

DocumenterCitations.jl is still in early development so please open issues if you encounter any bugs or pain points, would like
to see a new feature, or if you have any questions.

## Installation instructions

You can install the latest version of DocumenterCitations.jl using the built-in package manager (accessed by pressing `]` in the
Julia command prompt) to add the package and instantiate/build all dependencies

```julia
julia>]
(v1.5) pkg> add DocumenterCitations
```

## Quickstart

You just need a BibTeX `.bib` file to get started! Let's call it `some_references.bib`. You want to create a `CitationBibliography`
and pass it to `makedocs`:

```julia
using DocumenterCitations

cite_bib = CitationBibliography("some_references.bib")
makedocs(cite_bib, ...)
```

Now you can use

```
    ```@bibliography
    ```
```

on any page to generate a full list of formatted references. You can also use `[key](@cite)` on any page where `key` is the name of
the BibTex entry to create a citation that automatically links to the appropriate entry in the bibliography.
