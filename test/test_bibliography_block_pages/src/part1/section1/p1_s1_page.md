**Content**

The content matches the bibliography. The point of this (here and in the following pages) is to verify that the `Pages` attribute behaves consistently between `@contents` blocks and `@bibliography` blocks.

```@contents
Pages = ["p1_s1_page.md"]
```

**Bibliography**

```@bibliography
Canonical = false
Pages = ["p1_s1_page.md"]
```
