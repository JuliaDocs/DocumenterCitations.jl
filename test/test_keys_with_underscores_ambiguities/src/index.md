# Testing citation keys with underscores


## Problem description


In principle, both underscores and asterisks can be used transparently, as they get normalized. We can have [rabiner_tutorial_1989](@cite), [rabiner_tutorial*1989](@cite), and [rabiner*tutorial*1989](@cite).

Similarly, [Goerz_Q*2022](@cite) and [Goerz_Q_2022](@cite).
