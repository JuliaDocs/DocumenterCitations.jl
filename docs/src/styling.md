# CSS Styling

For optimal rendering of the bibliography, place a file [`citations.css`](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/QuantumCitations.jl/blob/master/docs/src/assets/citations.css) in the `docs/src/assets` folder of your project, containing, e.g.,

~~~@eval
using Markdown
css_file = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "src", "assets", "citations.css")
if isfile(css_file)
    Markdown.parse("""
    ```css
    $(read(css_file, String))
    ```
    """)
end
~~~

The HTML generated by `QuantumCitations` also uses CSS classes `canonical` and `noncanonical` to distinguish between [canonical](@ref canonical) and [non-canonical](@ref noncanonical) blocks. While these are not used in the above `citations.css`, a custom `citations.css` could implement different formatting for the two types of bibliographies.

The `citations.css` file must be listed as an `asset` for `Documenter.HTML` in [`docs/make.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaQuantumControl/QuantumCitations.jl/blob/master/docs/make.jl):

```julia
makedocs(
    bib,
    # ...
    format = Documenter.HTML(
        # ...
        assets=String["assets/citations.css"],
    ),
    # ...
)
```
